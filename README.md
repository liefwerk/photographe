Photographe is a web application made for amateur photographs.

It is entirely open source and will always stay free of charge.

## Ease of use

The end user should not have to know how to code to use this application.

Accessibility will be heavily reviewed.

## Ecologically responsible :leaves:

The application uses somes techniques to ease the computation process:
- caching the images
- using different sizes for the images, respecting the ratio

## TODO

- [] Store the processing of the images in multiple functions 
- [] Think of maximum height of an image 
- [] Set up lazy loading for images 
- [] Set up infinite scroll for images
